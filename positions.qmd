We occasionally have job openings at various levels, usually related to new grant funding. 
These are posted on the [LSHTM jobs site](https://jobs.lshtm.ac.uk/vacancies.aspx) and [iddjobs](https://iddjobs.org/). 
Even when there are no jobs advertised it is worth [contacting us](contact) if you are interested in joining the group, as we may have things coming up or in the pipeline.

We also enjoy hosting visitors for individual projects and fellowships for longer ones.
If you are interested in visiting us for any amount of time, please [get in touch](contact).
