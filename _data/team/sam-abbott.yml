  My main interest lies in developing, evaluating, and applying methods for improving our understanding of infectious disease dynamics in real-time.
  I am committed to doing science in the open, and collaboratively, with the aim of producing useful and actionable output. Most of my recent work has
  been targeted towards the COVID-19 response but my underlying focus is pathogen agnostic sparse data settings. My current main areas of work are
  [developing](https://epiforecasts.io/epinowcast/) and [evaluating](https://epiforecasts.io/eval-germany-sp-nowcasting/) methods for nowcasting right
  truncated data, [developing](https://epiforecasts.io/forecast.vocs) and [evaluating](https://github.com/epiforecasts/evaluate-delta-for-forecasting)
  methods to forecast and understand variant dynamics, reconstructing unobserved infections from a range of data sources (such as [count data](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2)
  and [prevalence measures](https://github.com/epiforecasts/inc2prev)),and better understanding the interaction, and use cases for, [effective reproduction number estimates](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2),
  [growth rate estimates, and generation time estimates](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.08.22268920). See my [personal website](https://samabbott.co.uk)
  for more detail on my current research and interests.
