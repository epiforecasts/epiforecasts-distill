  Liza is a postdoc exploring the role of infectious disease modelling in outbreak response. She is interested in how mathematical modelling is used by governments, health organisations and other decision-makers during a health crisis, and whether the process can be improved. Our recent study interviewed modellers and policy and decision-makers in 13 countries that used modelling for Covid-19 response, drawing together experiences and lessons learned in time for the next crisis. Liza is now based at CU Boulder/Cambridge but is still part of the Epiforecasts team.
