  Liza is a final-year PhD student exploring the role of infectious disease modelling in outbreak response. She is interested in how mathematical modelling is used by governments, health organisations and other decision-makers during a health crisis, and whether the process can be improved. Our current study aims to interview modellers and decision-makers in every major country that has used modelling for Covid-19 response, drawing together experiences and lessons learned in time for the next crisis. Liza is a joint Cambridge-LSHTM PhD student.
