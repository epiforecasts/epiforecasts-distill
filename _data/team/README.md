## How to create or edit a team member ID card

This folder contains all the (current and former) team member ID cards.

When a new person join the team, they should create a new ID card. When
a person leaves the team, they should switch the `current-member` flag
to `false` (but not delete their card as it is used to list the former
team members).

The validity of the yaml file is automatically checked with a [GitHub
Action](https://github.com/epiforecasts/epiforecasts-distill/blob/main/.github/workflows/validate-team-member-id.yaml)
on pushes and pull requests.

#### `name`

`string`

### Optional fields
